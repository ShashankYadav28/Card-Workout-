# Card-Workout-
CardWorkout is an iOS fitness app that turns a deck of cards into a workout game. Each card shows an exercise, and its value decides the reps (e.g., 2 of Diamonds = 2 pushups). Start, stop, or restart anytime for a fun, randomized workout session.

# 📱 Features
- 🎴 Random card draw to decide your next exercise  
- 💪 Different exercises mapped to card suits  
- 🔄 Continuous shuffling for endless workouts  
- 🖼️ Clean and minimal UI built with **SwiftUI**  
- 🏋️ Fitness-oriented and beginner friendly  

## 🃏 Card Rules
- **Hearts ❤️** → Push-Ups  
- **Clubs ♣️** → Sit-Ups  
- **Diamonds ♦️** → Jumping Jacks  
- **Spades ♠️** → Squats  

The **card value** determines the number of reps (e.g., 7 of Hearts = 7 Push-Ups).
